Subject: Prayer for leave of absence.

Dear Sir,

I beg most respectfully to state that I am a student of your course. I am suddenly not being able to attain the next class on Wednesday. I want to cover the class later by having consultancy from you.

May I therefore pray and hope that you would allow me and consider favorably.

Sincerely,
